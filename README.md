## About me

Hi! I write games and I like it! I'm Alex and welcome to my Github! I'm Gamedev and Gamedesigner and I upload my projects to Github to share them and discuss how they are programmed, which you will find later in this archive.

The reason is that I like my public repositories to be educational first and foremost. In the README you will find hints on how to improve the code!

If you like what I do, please follow me on my social networks!

## About the project

This project is a website I created in 2017 to study languages. I originally created it in native PHP, then with CodeIgniter 3 and then I upgraded to CodeIgniter 4. Actual version is 4.4.2

On this website you can write words in your mother tongue and in English, and then practise memorising them with a "game" in which the word appears and you have to guess its meaning.

In addition, you can also save sentences and you will have two error records, one with the words that will appear in the game and another with all your errors.

If the selected language is Spanish, you will also have another "game" with irregular verbs in English.

## About the development and improvements

The project was originally created to study English, but I have decided to upload it to github because I think it can help other people to study English, and even modify it to study another language.

This project was always an amateur project that I created in my spare time. 

In the JavaScript section, functions can be refactored. The project uses PHP 8, JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 for the design. It was developed using XAMPP as Apache server.

## Installation

-Update the project with Composer in root folder and Node in assets folder. <br />
